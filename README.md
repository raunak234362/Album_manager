# Album Manager

Welcome to Album Manager, a React-based web application for managing your albums. This simple application allows you to interact with a dummy API to perform basic CRUD operations on albums.

## Features

1. **Fetch and Display Albums**
   - Utilizes the [JSONPlaceholder](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/albums) API to fetch and display albums.
   - Renders album information, including title and ID.

2. **Add an Album**
   - Performs a dummy POST request to [JSONPlaceholder](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/albums) to simulate adding an album.
   - Saves the newly added album in the React state.

3. **Update an Album**
   - Simulates updating an album by making a dummy PUT request to [JSONPlaceholder](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/albums).
   - Reflects the changes in the React state.

4. **Delete an Album**
   - Simulates deleting an album by making a dummy DELETE request to [JSONPlaceholder](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/albums).
   - Updates the React state to reflect the removal of the album.
